# Llambada-v0 🐑 🎵

❗Note: This repository is in-progress for the improvement, please create the issue or contact with us if are there any issues. 


Welcome to the official implementation of Llambada version 0 repository! This project provides the tools and resources to use the Llambada model, an advanced system for music generation.

- Paper: [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1234.56789-b31b1b.svg?style=flat-square)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01661)

- Project page: [Llambada demo](https://songgen-ai.github.io/llambada-demo/)

This model is trained on totally 4.4k music hours dataset with 2xA100 GPUS. The training cost for this model is about 720 USD in 5 days for 2 stages: the semantic stage and the coarse stage.

⭐ Hopefully, we want open the a.i for everyone, so all of the source code of the model, the training script, and the hyperparameters will be released :)

Please note: At this time, the repository includes only the inference code and pre-trained model checkpoint. Training scripts will be added in a future update.

### ☑️ Release checklist

- [x] Model code
- [x] Inference script
- [x] Checkpoint
- [ ] Update mix audio script for vocal and accompaniment
- [ ] Training script
- [ ] Gradio inference
- [ ] Model serving

### Demo 

Some of our demos can be found here, with the following input and output:

- **Input:** Vocal + prompt

- **Output:** Accompaniment

We then mix them together for the final song, which you can listen at the mixed results

#### Demo 1

**Prompt**: Music beat for movie with  acoustic, female vocals,  piano,  guitar,  bass

**Vocal**

#### Demo 2

**Prompt**: Music beat with romantic, female vocals,  piano, bass, love song,  movie soundtrack

**Vocal**:

### 🛠️ Installation
Follow the steps below to set up your Python 3.10 environment using Conda and install the required dependencies.

Step 1: Create the environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate llambada
```
Step 2: Install dependencies
Install ffmpeg (for ubuntu, the script is here) and the dependencies.
``` bash
apt update && apt install ffmpeg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 🚅 Training (Coming Soon)
Instructions and scripts for training will be provided in a future release.

### Pretrained checkpoint

All of the checkpoints for semantic stage and the coarse stage can be downloaded in the [HuggingFace of SongGen](https://huggingface.co/songgen/Llambada)

### Pretrained setup

After downloading the checkpoints, you need to create the ```ckpts/``` folder, then you move all files to the ```ckpts/``` folder. 

Regarding the tokenizer ```bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt.gz```, you need to copy that file to the ```/workspace/llambada_test/LLambada/models/base/tokenizers/laion_clap/clap_module``` for the setup.

### 🖥️ Inference
Utilize the pre-trained Llambada model to generate music easily.

To run the inference, please run via the python file below:

``` bash
python infer.py
```

Create stunning music compositions with Llambada effortlessly!

Moreover, you can change the gpu for the inference via add this config to the front ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<your device id> ```

Total inference time for 10 seconds singing accompaniment is about 1 minute and 30 seconds on 1xH100.
